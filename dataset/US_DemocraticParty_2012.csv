"Moving America Forward 2012 Democratic National Platform",NA,NA,NA
"Moving America Forward",NA,NA,NA
"Four years ago, Democrats, independents, and many Republicans came together as Americans to move our country forward.",NA,"000",NA
"We were in the midst of the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression,",NA,"408",NA
"the previous administration had put two wars on our nation’s credit card,",NA,"305",NA
"and the American Dream had slipped out of reach for too many.",NA,"601",NA
"Today, our economy is growing again,",NA,"408",NA
"al-Qaeda is weaker than at any point since 9/11,",NA,"104",NA
"and our manufacturing sector is growing for the first time in more than a decade.",NA,"410",NA
"But there is more we need to do, and so we come together again to continue what we started.",NA,"000",NA
"We gather to reclaim the basic bargain that built the largest middle class and the most prosperous nation on Earth –",NA,"601",NA
"the simple principle that in America, hard work should pay off,",NA,"601",NA
"responsibility should be rewarded,",NA,"601",NA
"and each one of us should be able to go as far as our talent and drive take us.",NA,"601",NA
"This election is not simply a choice between two candidates or two political parties,",NA,"000",NA
"but between two fundamentally different paths for our country and our families.",NA,"000",NA
"We Democrats offer America the opportunity to move our country forward by creating an economy built to last and built from the middle out.",NA,"408",NA
"Mitt Romney and the Republican Party have a drastically different vision.",NA,"305",NA
"They still believe the best way to grow the economy is from the top down",NA,"305",NA
"– the same approach that benefited the wealthy few but crashed the economy and crushed the middle class.",NA,"408",NA
"Democrats see a young country continually made stronger by the greatest diversity of talent and ingenuity in the world,",NA,"607",NA
"and a nation of people drawn to our shores from every corner of the globe.",NA,"607",NA
"We believe America can succeed because the American people have never failed",NA,"601",NA
"and there is nothing that together we cannot accomplish.",NA,"601",NA
"Reclaiming the economic security of the middle class is the challenge we must overcome today.",NA,"403",NA
"That begins by restoring the basic values that made our country great,",NA,"601",NA
"and restoring for everyone who works hard and plays by the rules the opportunity to find a job that pays the bills, turn an idea into a profitable business, care for your family, afford a home you call your own and health care you can count on, retire with dignity and respect,",NA,"503",NA
"and, most of all, give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger and go even further than you ever imagined.",NA,"506",NA
"This has to be our North Star – an economy that’s built not from the top down, but from a growing middle class,",NA,"704",NA
"and that provides ladders of opportunity for those working hard to join the middle class.",NA,"402",NA
"This is not another trivial political argument.",NA,"000",NA
"It’s the defining issue of our time and at the core of the American Dream.",NA,"601",NA
"And now we stand at a make-or-break moment, and are faced with a choice between moving forward and falling back.",NA,"000",NA
"The Republican Party has turned its back on the middle class Americans who built this country.",NA,"305",NA
"Our opponents believe we should go back to the top-down economic policies of the last decade.",NA,"403",NA
"They think that if we simply eliminate protections for families and consumers, let Wall Street write its own rules again, and cut taxes for the wealthiest, the market will solve all our problems on its own.",NA,"305",NA
"They argue that if we help corporations and wealthy investors maximize their profits by whatever means necessary, whether through layoffs or outsourcing, it will automatically translate into jobs and prosperity that benefits us all.",NA,"408",NA
"They would repeal health reform,",NA,"504",NA
"turn Medicare into a voucher program,",NA,NA,NA
"and follow the same path of fiscal irresponsibility of the past administration – giving trillions of dollars in tax cuts weighted towards millionaires and billionaires while sticking the middle class with the bill.",NA,"403",NA
"But we’ve tried their policies – and we’ve all suffered when they failed.",NA,"305",NA
"It is not enough to go back to where the country was before the crisis.",NA,"601",NA
"We must rebuild a strong foundation that ensures it never happens again.",NA,"601",NA
"Democrats know that America prospers when we’re all in it together.",NA,"606",NA
"We see an America where everyone has a fair shot, does their fair share, and plays by the same rules.",NA,"503",NA
"We see an America that out-educates, out-builds, and out-innovates the rest of the world.",NA,"601",NA
"We see an America with greater economic security and opportunity, driven by education, energy, innovation and infrastructure, and a tax code that helps to create American jobs",NA,"408",NA
"and bring down the debt in a balanced way.",NA,"414",NA
"We believe in deficit reduction not by placing the burden on the middle class and the poor, but by cutting out programs we can’t afford",NA,"303",NA
"and asking the wealthiest to again contribute their fair share.",NA,"503",NA
"These values are why we enacted historic health care reform that provides economic security for families",NA,"504",NA
"and enacted sweeping financial reform legislation that will prevent the recklessness that cost so many their jobs, homes, and savings.",NA,"403",NA
"They’re why we rescued the auto industry",NA,"403",NA
"and revived our manufacturing supply chain.",NA,"410",NA
"They’re why we helped American families who are working multiple jobs and struggling to pay the bills save a little extra money through tax cuts, lower health care costs, and affordable student loans.",NA,"603",NA
"They’re why we fought to reclaim the value of treating all Americans with dignity and respect.",NA,"201",NA
"And they’re why President Barack Obama has ended one war and is responsibly drawing down another.",NA,"105",NA
"They’re why we’re restoring our alliances and image around the world",NA,"107",NA
"and pursuing a foreign policy that’s making us safer.",NA,"107",NA
"But there is more to be done.",NA,"000",NA
"We knew that renewing the American Dream wouldn’t be easy – we knew it would take more than one year, or one term, or even one president.",NA,"601",NA
"The problems we’re facing right now have been more than a decade in the making.",NA,"000",NA
"We are the party of inclusion and respect differences of perspective and belief.",NA,"503",NA
"And so, even when we disagree, we work together to move this country forward.",NA,"606",NA
"But what is holding our nation back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views of which direction America should take.",NA,"305",NA
"We must keep moving forward and doing the hard work of rebuilding a strong economy",NA,"408",NA
"by betting on the American worker",NA,"701",NA
"and investing in a growing middle class.",NA,"704",NA
"We need a government that stands up for the hopes, values, and interests of working people,",NA,"701",NA
"and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their God-given potential.",NA,"503",NA
"Rebuilding Middle Class Security",NA,NA,NA
"We’ve come a long way since 2008.",NA,"305",NA
"The President took office in the middle of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression; that month 800,000 Americans lost their jobs – more than in any single month in the previous 60 years.",NA,"305",NA
"On Day One, he took immediate action to stop the free fall and put Americans back to work. In the midst of the crisis,",NA,"305",NA
"President Obama knew what Democrats have always known: that American workers are tougher than tough times.",NA,"701",NA
"Since early 2010, the private sector has created 4.5 million jobs,",NA,"701",NA
"and American manufacturing is growing for the first time since the 1990s.",NA,"410",NA
"The President knew from the start that to rebuild true middle class security, we can’t just cut our way to prosperity.",NA,"402",NA
"We must out-educate, out-innovate, and out-build the world.",NA,NA,NA
"We need an economy that creates the jobs of the future and makes things the rest of the world buys –",NA,"410",NA
"not one built on outsourcing, loopholes, or risky financial deals that jeopardize everyone, especially the middle class.",NA,"403",NA
"We’ve already made historic progress.",NA,"305",NA
"States have more flexibility to raise standards and reform schools,",NA,"506",NA
"more students are receiving grants and scholarships,",NA,"506",NA
"and young adults can stay on their parents’ health insurance plans as they finish their education and enter the workforce.",NA,"504",NA
"More working families than ever before have received tax cuts,",NA,"401",NA
"and fuel-efficiency standards are doubling.",NA,"501",NA
"The President cracked down on Wall Street recklessness",NA,"403",NA
"and abuses by health insurance, credit card, and mortgage companies.",NA,"403",NA
"Our work is far from done.",NA,"000",NA
"A crisis this deep didn’t happen overnight and it won’t be solved overnight.",NA,"408",NA
"Too many parents sit around their kitchen tables at night after they’ve put their kids to bed, worrying about how they will make a mortgage payment or pay the rent, or how they will put their children through college.",NA,"408",NA
"We now stand at a make-or-break moment for families,",NA,"603",NA
"and America faces a clear choice in this election: move forward toward a nation built from the middle class out where everyone has the chance to get ahead,",NA,"503",NA
"or go back to the same failed ideas that created the crisis in the first place.",NA,"408",NA
"The Republicans in Congress and Mitt Romney have a very different idea about where they want to take this country.",NA,"305",NA
"To pay for their trillions in additional tax cuts weighted towards millionaires and billionaires, they’ll raise taxes on the middle class",NA,"403",NA
"and gut our investments in education, research and technology, and new roads, bridges, and airports.",NA,"411",NA
"They’ll end Medicare as we know it.",NA,"504",NA
"They want to let Wall Street write its own rules again",NA,"403",NA
"and allow insurance companies to once again deny health care to working families.",NA,"504",NA
"Their troubling and familiar economic scheme doubles down on the same bad ideas of the last decade while arguing that, somehow, this time, they’ll lead to a different result.",NA,"408",NA
"We can’t afford to go back or abandon the change we’ve fought so hard for.",NA,"000",NA
"We have to move forward.",NA,"601",NA
"Putting Americans Back to Work",NA,NA,NA
"When President Obama took office, the economy was in the deepest economic crisis since the Great Depression.",NA,"414",NA
"His Recovery Act represented the largest education investment since President Johnson,",NA,"305",NA
"the largest infrastructure investment since President Eisenhower,",NA,"411",NA
"the single largest clean energy investment ever,",NA,"416",NA
"and the broadest tax cut in American history.",NA,"401",NA
"It helped keep teachers, police officers, nurses, and firefighters on the job.",NA,"701",NA
"It ensured that as we re-built our country, we bought American-made iron, steel, and manufactured goods wherever feasible, consistent with our international obligations.",NA,"406",NA
"It helped the President stop the bleeding and reverse the free fall.",NA,"305",NA
"But just as the recession was not created overnight, we knew it would take time to recover from the crisis – and more needs to be done.",NA,"408",NA
"Last September, President Obama put forward the American Jobs Act to provide an immediate boost to the economy and strengthen the recovery.",NA,"701",NA
"We have already enacted key parts of the American Jobs Act – payroll tax relief, tax credits for businesses that hire veterans,",NA,"701",NA
"and an extension of unemployment insurance that also included reforms like work-sharing,",NA,"701",NA
"a “Bridge to Work” to help the long-term unemployed reconnect with the labor force,",NA,"701",NA
"and support for unemployed workers looking to become entrepreneurs.",NA,"701",NA
"But Republicans in Congress blocked other provisions that independent analysis said could create one million jobs.",NA,"305",NA
"Even as President Obama remains committed to working with both parties, he and his cabinet pursued a series of executive actions to help spark economic growth and job creation,",NA,"410",NA
"including expanding access to refinancing for families who have stayed current on their mortgages,",NA,"402",NA
"challenging Community Health Centers to hire veterans,",NA,"104",NA
"accelerating permitting for transportation projects,",NA,"411",NA
"cutting waste and reducing improper payments,",NA,"414",NA
"and enabling student loan borrowers to cap their payments at a percentage of income.",NA,"403",NA
"That’s why President Obama and the Democratic Party have cut taxes on American workers and businesses",NA,"402",NA
"and made sweeping reforms to the unemployment system to help get people back to work.",NA,"701",NA
"And we continue to fight for measures that would strengthen the recovery and create jobs now,",NA,"701",NA
"including keeping teachers and first responders on the job, putting construction workers back to work by investing in our roads, bridges, schools, and water supply, helping families refinance their mortgages and save hundreds of dollars a month, cutting taxes for small businesses that invest and hire, and putting veterans back to work.",NA,"701",NA
"That’s why we continue to fight for relief for the long-term unemployed,",NA,"701",NA
"including a ban on hiring discrimination against the unemployed",NA,"503",NA
"and a reformed and expanded universal worker training proposal to provide more training and job search assistance to all displaced workers regardless of how they lost their job.",NA,"701",NA
"The President’s plan includes many measures that have long had bipartisan support.",NA,"305",NA

"A typical family has saved $3,600 during his first term.",NA,"603",NA
"Now he’s fighting to stop middle class families and those aspiring to join the middle class from seeing their taxes go up",NA,"704",NA
"and to extend key tax relief for working families and those paying for college,",NA,"402",NA
"while asking the wealthiest and corporations to pay their fair share.",NA,"503",NA
"That is why we will always vigorously oppose the type of tax reform supported by Mitt Romney which independent experts have found would require raising taxes on typical families with children by at least $2,000 if it were paid for.",NA,"408",NA
"At the same time, Mitt Romney’s plan would cut taxes for those making over $3 million by an average of $250,000",NA,"403",NA
"and would create incentives that will lead to hundreds of thousands of jobs going overseas at the expense of American workers.",NA,"406",NA
"Health Care. We believe accessible, affordable, high quality health care is part of the American promise,",NA,"504",NA
"that Americans should have the security that comes with good health care,",NA,"504",NA

"People with private insurance are getting preventive services like cancer screenings, annual well-woman visits, and FDA-approved contraception with no out-of-pocket costs.",NA,"504",NA
"We’ve established new Offices of Minority Health,",NA,"504",NA
"and are helping state Medicaid programs fund home and community-based services.",NA,"504",NA
"Small businesses are receiving tax credits to help them cover their workers,",NA,"402",NA
"and businesses and families are receiving rebates from insurers who overcharged them.",NA,"403",NA
"Soon, working families will finally have the security of knowing they won’t lose health care or be forced into bankruptcy if a family member gets sick or loses their job.",NA,"504",NA
"And soon, insurance companies will no longer be able to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions.",NA,"403",NA
"Medicaid will cover more working families.",NA,"701",NA

"Mitt Romney and the Republican Party would repeal health reform.",NA,"305",NA
"They are more concerned with playing politics than supporting families in this country.",NA,"305",NA
"No law is perfect and Democrats stand willing to work with anyone to improve the law where necessary, but we are committed to moving forward.",NA,"305",NA
"We will continue to stand up to Republicans working to take away the benefits and protections that are already helping millions of Americans every day.",NA,"305",NA
"We refuse to go back to the days when health insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your health policy, deny you coverage, or charge women more than men.",NA,"504",NA

"Democrats will continue to fight for a strong health care workforce with an emphasis on primary care.",NA,"504",NA

"And we will continue to support America’s groundbreaking biomedical researchers in their lifesaving work.",NA,"411",NA
"Stabilizing the Housing Market and Hard-Hit Communities. For more than a decade, irresponsible lenders tricked buyers into signing subprime loans while too many homeowners got in over their heads by buying homes they couldn’t afford.",NA,"403",NA
"But when the housing bubble burst, it hurt everyone, including responsible homeowners who played by the rules, but saw their home values decline and their neighbors’ houses sit vacant.",NA,"408",NA
"The housing market’s dramatic collapse did more than punish millions of innocent Americans; it also triggered the economy’s downward spiral into recession.",NA,"408",NA

"Too many people still owe more on their homes than they are worth.",NA,"408",NA

"We also recognize there is no substitute for a parent’s involvement in their child’s education.",NA,"603",NA
"To help keep college within reach for every student, Democrats took on banks to reform our student loan program, saving more than $60 billion by removing the banks acting as middlemen so we can better and more directly invest in students.",NA,"403",NA
"To make college affordable for students of all backgrounds and confront the loan burden our students shoulder, we doubled our investment in Pell Grant scholarships and created the American Opportunity Tax Credit worth up to $10,000 over four years of college,",NA,"506",NA

"He supports dramatic cuts to Head Start and the Pell Grant program.",NA,"506",NA
"Tuition at public colleges has soared over the last decade and students are graduating with more and more debt;",NA,"506",NA

"We Democrats have focused on making sure that taxpayer dollars support high-quality education programs,",NA,"506",NA
"but Mitt Romney is a staunch supporter of expensive, for-profit schools – schools that often leave students buried in debt and without the skills for quality jobs and that prey on our servicemembers and veterans.",NA,"506",NA
"Cutting Waste, Reducing the Deficit, Asking All to Pay Their Fair Share",NA,NA,NA
"After the previous administration put two wars and tax cuts weighted towards the wealthy on the nation’s credit card,",NA,"305",NA

"As the Bush administration shifted its focus to Iraq, Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda established safe havens across the border from Afghanistan, in Pakistan.",NA,"104",NA

"As a consequence of the President’s decisions and the brave work of our military and intelligence professionals, bin Laden can no longer threaten the United States and al-Qaeda’s senior leadership has been devastated, rendering the group far less capable than it was four years ago.",NA,"104",NA
"The al-Qaeda core in Afghanistan and Pakistan has never been weaker.",NA,"104",NA

"But by the time President Obama took office, we had lost sight of those goals.",NA,"305",NA
"So the President refocused our efforts there in 2009, setting the clear goal of defeating al-Qaeda and denying it an ability to reestablish a safe haven in Afghanistan.",NA,"104",NA
"Because of the deteriorating security situation, he sent additional resources to reverse the Taliban’s momentum and to give the Afghans the time and space to build the capacity of their security forces.",NA,"104",NA
"We have accomplished that, and now we have begun the process of bringing our troops home from Afghanistan, including removing 33,000 by September 2012.",NA,"104",NA

"Beyond 2014, we will continue to provide counterterrorism and training assistance and to build an enduring relationship with Afghanistan, as outlined by the U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement concluded in May.",NA,"107",NA

"It will require patience, perseverance, and the steady accumulation of concrete actions.",NA,"104",NA
"But real progress has already been made.",NA,"104",NA
"Reducing Nuclear Weapons Stockpiles. The Obama administration has moved away from Cold War thinking by reducing the prominence of nuclear weapons in America’s national security strategy, and it has urged others to do the same.",NA,"105",NA
"As long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure, and effective arsenal to deter any adversary and guarantee the defense of our allies.",NA,"104",NA
"But President Obama has taken important steps to decrease America’s nuclear arsenal and is committed to further responsible reductions.",NA,"105",NA
"To reduce our warheads and stockpile, lower the threat of a nuclear exchange, and lay the foundation for future progress, President Obama negotiated and signed the landmark New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia,",NA,"105",NA
"producing cuts in each side’s deployed nuclear stockpiles and launchers and allowing us to monitor and verify Russia’s arsenal.",NA,"105",NA
"Yet despite bipartisan consensus among former National Security Advisors, Secretaries of Defense, and Secretaries of State that New START makes America safer, Mitt Romney strongly objected to the treaty.",NA,"305",NA
"Moving forward, the President will work with Russia to achieve additional reductions in stockpiles and nuclear delivery vehicles, including tactical and non-deployed nuclear weapons.",NA,"105",NA

"Preventing Nuclear Proliferation. President Obama and the Democratic Party are also committed to strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as the bedrock of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries.",NA,"107",NA

"we will insist that countries without nuclear weapons comply with their obligations not to develop them,",NA,"107",NA

"Iran. President Obama, working closely with our international partners and Congress, has put in place unprecedented sanctions against Iran.",NA,"102",NA
"Iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon, but has continually failed to meet its obligations under the NPT and several United Nations Security Council resolutions,",NA,"107",NA
"and it cannot demonstrate with any credibility that its program is peaceful.",NA,"106",NA
"The President is committed to using all instruments of national power to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.",NA,"104",NA
"When President Obama took office, Iran was ascendant in the region, and the international community was divided over how to address Iran’s nuclear violations.",NA,"107",NA
"The President’s early offer of engagement with Iran – quickly rebuffed by the regime – allowed the United States to expose Iranian intransigence and rally the international community as never before.",NA,"107",NA
"Working with our European allies and with Russia and China, the administration gained unprecedented agreement for the toughest ever UN sanctions against Iran,",NA,"107",NA
"laying the foundation for additional national financial and energy sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations.",NA,"107",NA
"As a result, Iran is now increasingly isolated and the regime faces crippling economic pressure – pressure that will only build over time.",NA,"102",NA
"President Obama believes that a diplomatic outcome remains the best and most enduring solution.",NA,"107",NA
"At the same time, he has also made clear that the window for diplomacy will not remain open indefinitely and that all options – including military force – remain on the table.",NA,"104",NA
"But we have an obligation to use the time and space that exists now to put increasing pressure on the Iranian regime to live up to its obligations and rejoin the community of nations, or face the consequences.",NA,"107",NA
"North Korea. President Obama will also continue to confront North Korea, another regime that ignores its international obligations by developing nuclear weapons and missile technology, with a stark choice: take verifiable steps toward denuclearization",NA,"107",NA
"or face increasing isolation and costs from the United States and the international community.",NA,"107",NA
"That is why the administration worked with international partners to impose the harshest multilateral sanctions on North Korea in history.",NA,"107",NA
"And it is why the President has made clear that the transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States and our allies, and we would hold North Korea accountable for the consequences of such action.",NA,"107",NA
"Securing Loose Nuclear Materials. The President has led a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials around the world,",NA,"107",NA
"hosting a nuclear security summit in Washington,",NA,"107",NA

"This is an important goal because the prospect that al-Qaeda or another terrorist organization might acquire a nuclear device represents an immediate and extreme threat to global security.",NA,"107",NA
"At the same time, the United States will continue to work with international partners to break up black markets,",NA,"107",NA
"detect and intercept nuclear materials in transit,",NA,"107",NA

"Russia. Crucial to achieving all of these objectives has been, and will remain, expanded cooperation with Russia.",NA,"107",NA
"The Cold War mentality represented by Mitt Romney’s identification of Russia as “our number one geopolitical foe” ignores the very real common interest we share with Russia in reducing nuclear stockpiles,",NA,"107",NA

"We support establishing permanent, normal trade relations with Russia because it would be good for the U.S. economy, for U.S. businesses, and for U.S. workers if we do.",NA,"107",NA
