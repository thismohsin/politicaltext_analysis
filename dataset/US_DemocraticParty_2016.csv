"Preamble",NA,"H",NA
"In 2016, Democrats meet in Philadelphia with the same basic belief that animated the Continental Congress when they gathered here 240 years ago: Out of many, we are one.",NA,"601.1",NA
"Under President Obama’s leadership,",NA,"305.1",NA
"and thanks to the hard work and determination of the American people, we have come a long way from the Great Recession and the Republican policies that triggered it.",NA,"601.1",NA
"American businesses have now added 14.8 million jobs since private-sector job growth turned positive in early 2010.",NA,"410",NA
"Twenty million people have gained health insurance coverage.",NA,"504",NA
"The American auto industry just had its best year ever.",NA,"410",NA
"And we are getting more of our energy from the sun and wind, and importing less oil from overseas.",NA,"501",NA
"But too many Americans have been left out and left behind.",NA,"503",NA
"They are working longer hours with less security.",NA,"403",NA
"Wages have barely budged",NA,"403",NA
"and the racial wealth gap remains wide,",NA,"503",NA
"while the cost of everything from childcare to a college education has continued to rise.",NA,"403",NA
"And for too many families, the dream of homeownership is out of reach.",NA,"401",NA
"As working people struggle, the top one percent accrues more wealth and more power.",NA,"403",NA
"Republicans in Congress have chosen gridlock and dysfunction over trying to find solutions to the real challenges we face.",NA,"305.1",NA
"It’s no wonder that so many feel like the system is rigged against them.",NA,"403",NA
"Democrats believe that cooperation is better than conflict,",NA,"601.1",NA
"unity is better than division,",NA,"601.1",NA
"empowerment is better than resentment,",NA,"503",NA

"It’s a simple but powerful idea: we are stronger together.",NA,"601.1",NA
"Democrats believe we are stronger when we have an economy that works for everyone",NA,"403",NA
"—an economy that grows incomes for working people,",NA,"701",NA
"creates good-paying jobs,",NA,"701",NA
"and puts a middle-class life within reach for more Americans.",NA,"503",NA
"Democrats believe we can spur more sustainable economic growth,",NA,"416.2",NA
"which will create good-paying jobs and raise wages.",NA,"701",NA
"And we can have more economic fairness,",NA,"403",NA
"so the rewards are shared broadly, not just with those at the top.",NA,"503",NA
"We need an economy that prioritizes long-term investment over short-term profit-seeking,",NA,"403",NA
"rewards the common interest over self-interest,",NA,"403",NA
"and promotes innovation and entrepreneurship.",NA,"401",NA
"We believe that today’s extreme level of income and wealth inequality—where the majority of the economic gains go to the top one percent and the richest 20 people in our country own more wealth than the bottom 150 million—makes our economy weaker,",NA,"403",NA
"our communities poorer,",NA,"403",NA
"and our politics poisonous.",NA,"602.1",NA
"And we know that our nation’s long struggle with race is far from over.",NA,"503",NA
"More than half a century after Rosa Parks sat and Dr. King marched and John Lewis bled, more than half a century after César Chávez, Dolores Huerta, and Larry Itliong organized, race still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind.",NA,"503",NA
"We must face that reality and we must fix it.",NA,"503",NA
"We believe a good education is a basic right of all Americans, no matter what zip code they live in.",NA,"506",NA

"Democrats believe we are stronger when we protect citizens’ right to vote, while stopping corporations’ outsized influence in elections.",NA,"403",NA
"We will fight to end the broken campaign finance system,",NA,"403",NA

"With this platform, we do not merely seek common ground—we strive to reach higher ground.",NA,"607.1",NA
"We are proud of our heritage as a nation of immigrants.",NA,"602.2",NA

"We believe in protecting civil liberties and guaranteeing civil rights and voting rights, women’s rights and workers’ rights, LGBT rights, and rights for people with disabilities.",NA,"503",NA
"We believe America is still, as Robert Kennedy said, “a great country, an unselfish country, and a compassionate country.”",NA,"601.1",NA
"These principles stand in sharp contrast to the Republicans,",NA,"305.1",NA
"who have nominated as the standard-bearer for their party and their candidate for President a man who seeks to appeal to Americans’ basest differences, rather than our better natures.",NA,"305.2",NA
"The stakes have been high in previous elections.",NA,"601.1",NA
"But in 2016, the stakes can be measured in human lives—in the number of immigrants who would be torn from their homes;",NA,"602.2",NA
"in the number of faithful and peaceful Muslims who would be barred from even visiting our shores;",NA,"503",NA
"in the number of allies alienated and dictators courted;",NA,"107",NA
"in the number of Americans who would lose access to health care and see their rights ripped away.",NA,"504",NA
"This election is about more than Democrats and Republicans.",NA,"601.1",NA
"It is about who we are as a nation, and who we will be in the future.",NA,"601.1",NA
"Two hundred and forty years ago, in Philadelphia, we started a revolution of ideas and of action that continues to this day.",NA,"601.1",NA
"Since then, our union has been tested many times, through bondage and civil war, segregation and depression, two world wars and the threat of nuclear annihilation.",NA,"601.1",NA
"Generations of Americans fought and marched and organized to widen the circle of opportunity and dignity—and we are fighting still.",NA,"601.1",NA

"and restore the basic bargain that built America’s mighty middle class:",NA,"704",NA
"If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead and stay ahead.",NA,"403",NA
"The system is not working when we have a rigged economy in which ordinary Americans work longer hours for lower wages,",NA,"403",NA
"while most new income and wealth goes to the top one percent.",NA,"403",NA
"Republican governors, legislatures, and their corporate allies have launched attack after attack on workers’ fundamental rights to organize and bargain collectively.",NA,"701",NA

"having access to affordable and quality childcare,",NA,"403",NA
"retiring with dignity",NA,"706",NA

"and have the right to form or join a union",NA,"701",NA
"and will work in every way we can—in Congress and the federal government, in states and with the private sector—to reach this goal.",NA,"701",NA
"We should raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over time and index it,",NA,"412",NA

"and has personally hired union-busting firms to undermine workers’ rights.",NA,"305.2",NA
"Democrats believe so-called “right to work” laws are wrong for workers—such as teachers and other public employees who serve our communities every day—and wrong for America.",NA,"701",NA

"We will abolish the death penalty, which has proven to be a cruel and unusual form of punishment.",NA,"605.2",NA
"It has no place in the United States of America.",NA,"605.2",NA
"The application of the death penalty is arbitrary and unjust.",NA,"503",NA
"The cost to taxpayers far exceeds those of life imprisonment.",NA,"303",NA
"It does not deter crime.",NA,"605.1",NA
"And, exonerations show a dangerous lack of reliability for what is an irreversible punishment.",NA,"605.2",NA
