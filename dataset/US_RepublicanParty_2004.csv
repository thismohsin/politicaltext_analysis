"We are dealing with terrorist threats as they gather, rather than waiting for them to become imminent dangers.",NA,"305",NA
"The results are clear to see.",NA,"305",NA
"•Three years ago, our nation was not on a war footing against al Qaeda - even though Osama bin Laden declared war on the United States in 1996 and again in 1998.",NA,"605",NA
"The al Qaeda leadership believed itself to be impervious to any American response, continued to raise funds practically without restriction, and operated in a world in which there was no cohesive global approach to fighting terror.",NA,"605",NA

"Today, because Saudi Arabia has seen the danger and has joined the War on Terror, the American people are safer.",NA,"101",NA
"•Three years ago, the ruler of Iraq was a sworn enemy of America who provided safe haven for terrorists, used weapons of mass destruction, and turned his nation into a prison.",NA,"102",NA
"Saddam Hussein was not just a dictator; he was a proven mass murderer who refused to account for weapons of mass murder.",NA,"102",NA
"He defied the international community and seventeen United Nations resolutions over the course of twelve years, giving no indication that Iraq would ever disarm and comply with the just demands of the world.",NA,"102",NA
"In 2002 - in Resolution 1441 - the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted that Saddam Hussein had one final chance to comply with his obligations to the international community, or there would be serious consequences.",NA,"102",NA

"Today, thousands of Libya's chemical munitions have been destroyed.",NA,"101",NA

"•Three years ago, a private weapons proliferation network was doing business around the world.",NA,"605",NA
"This network, operated by the Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, was selling nuclear plans and equipment to the highest bidder, and found willing buyers in places like Libya, Iran, and North Korea.",NA,"605",NA

"The forces of many nations are working with Afghans to find and defeat Taliban remnants and eliminate al Qaeda terrorists.",NA,"104",NA
"We applaud the work of American forces and coalition partners in helping to build the new Afghan national army and to train new Afghan police and border patrol.",NA,"104",NA

"On that point, President Bush, members of both parties in Congress, and the United Nations agreed.",NA,"104",NA
"While the stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction we expected to find in Iraq have not yet materialized, we have confirmed that Saddam Hussein had the capability to reconstitute his weapons programs and the desire to do so.",NA,"104",NA

"He chose defending America.",NA,"104",NA
"Supported by brave coalition allies such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Poland, and Denmark,",NA,"101",NA
"and displaying courage, skill, and resourcefulness on the battlefield, the men and women of our Armed Forces removed the dictator of Iraq, a declared enemy of America who had the capability and intent to produce weapons of mass murder, and could have passed that capability to terrorists bent on killing Americans.",NA,"104",NA

"Today's financial markets offer a variety of investment options, including some that guarantee a rate of return higher than the current Social Security system with no risk to the investor.",NA,"503",NA

"They must have choices.",NA,"503",NA
"•Assets in personal accounts should belong to each individual.",NA,"402",NA

"•Choice is the key.",NA,"402",NA
"Any new options for retirement security should be voluntary, so workers can choose to remain in the current system or opt for something different.",NA,"402",NA
"This is a challenge that demands leadership.",NA,"402",NA
"President Bush has shown this leadership by proposing a bold alternative to the collapse of Social Security.",NA,"402",NA
"Along with Americans everywhere, we pledge to join him in this endeavor of a lifetime.",NA,"402",NA
"Individual ownership of voluntary personal retirement accounts for today's workers will make Social Security more equitable, but, just as importantly, will put the system on sure financial footing.",NA,"504",NA

"Homeownership",NA,NA,NA

"Small businesses have been the primary vehicles of economic advance for American women.",NA,"404",NA
"Republicans pledged in 2000 to lower tax rates for small business owners and entrepreneurs, end the death tax, cut red tape, reform our liability system, and aggressively expand overseas markets for our goods and services.",NA,"404",NA
"Though more work remains to be done, including reauthorizing the Small Business Administration, President Bush and Congressional Republicans have made good on each of those commitments.",NA,"404",NA
"They have:",NA,NA,NA
"•Reduced taxes on 25 million small business owners and entrepreneurs.",NA,"402",NA
"Much of the tax relief came from reductions in individual income tax rates.",NA,"402",NA
"Ninety percent of businesses pay income taxes at individual rates, not corporate rates.",NA,"402",NA
"This includes hundreds of thousands of successful small business owners and entrepreneurs who pay taxes in the top tax rates and whose taxes would increase considerably under John Kerry's economic plan.",NA,"402",NA
"• Lowered the tax burden on investment in new equipment by quadrupling the limit on small business expensing from $25,000 to $100,000 and allowing additional first-year depreciation of that equipment.",NA,"402",NA
"•Phased-out the death tax that punishes family-owned small businesses and family farms.",NA,"402",NA
"•Increased federal contracts to small businesses.",NA,"402",NA
"In 2003, small businesses received the largest percentage ever of all federal contracts.",NA,"402",NA
"In addition, President Bush developed a strategy to reverse the trend toward bundling of contracts, a practice that has denied small businesses the ability to compete for billions of procurement dollars.",NA,"402",NA
"•Reduced paperwork.",NA,"402",NA
"For example, 22. 4 million small business taxpayers now have fewer lines to fill out on tax forms, freeing up an estimated 9. 5 million hours previously used for paperwork every year.",NA,"402",NA
"• Enacted Health Savings Accounts, which allow individuals to save and pay for their health care tax-free.",NA,"402",NA

"Frivolous lawsuits put more money in the pockets of trial lawyers and leave businesses with less money to create jobs.",NA,"402",NA

"We support efforts by President Bush, Congressional Republicans, and Republican governors to curb the burden of frivolous lawsuits.",NA,"402",NA
"We recognize that the Democrats' nominees, one of whom made his fortune as a trial lawyer, are beholden to the interests of the trial lawyer lobby and offer no hope for reform of this badly broken system.",NA,"402",NA
"Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)",NA,NA,NA

"Health Savings Accounts are now available to all Americans thanks to the efforts of President Bush and the Republican Congress.",NA,"402",NA
"The next step, which our Party endorses, is to extend tax deductibility to the insurance premiums associated with HSAs.",NA,"402",NA
"We also support efforts to expand the use of Health Savings Accounts to help control health care costs and give individuals more power in making important medical decisions.",NA,"402",NA
"Private Property Rights",NA,NA,NA
"The core of ownership in America has always been ownership of private property that a citizen can call his or her own.",NA,"402",NA
"Republicans respect this tradition.",NA,"402",NA

"By keeping the costs of running a business low and ensuring that our workers have the skills to compete in a dynamic global economy, President Bush and the Republican Congress will continue to ensure that America is the best nation in the world in which to create jobs.",NA,"408",NA
"Lower Taxes and Economic Growth",NA,NA,NA
"In 2001, President Bush and the Republican Congress worked together to pass the most sweeping tax relief in a generation.",NA,"408",NA
"By letting families, workers, and small business owners keep more of the money they earn, they helped bring America from recession to a steadily expanding economy.",NA,"408",NA
"Despite enduring the after-effects of the stock market's irrational exuberance in the late 1990s, terrorist attacks on our nation, and corporate scandals that bubbled to the surface after years of inattention, the U.S. economy has now grown for 33 straight months.",NA,"408",NA
"And unlike four years ago, there are no signs of an end to the current economic growth.",NA,"408",NA
"The proof is in the numbers, and the numbers prove our economy is strong and growing stronger.",NA,"408",NA
"•Over the past year, gross domestic product (GDP) grew at one of the fastest rates in two decades.",NA,"408",NA
"•Without the President's tax relief, real GDP would have been more than 3 percent lower and 2 million fewer Americans would have been working at the end of last year.",NA,"408",NA
"• Since last August, 1. 5 million new jobs have been created.",NA,"408",NA
"•The unemployment rate has fallen from 6. 3 to 5. 5 percent, which is below the average of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.",NA,"408",NA
"• Employment over the last year is up in 46 of the 50 states, and the unemployment rate is down in 49 of the 50 states.",NA,"408",NA
"In addition to the official figures, household surveys show that hundreds of thousands of new jobs have been created, unreported, through selfemployment and by small businesses.",NA,"408",NA
"• Real after-tax incomes are up by 9. 6 percent since December 2000.",NA,"408",NA
"•Homeownership rates are at record levels - seven out of ten American families own their own home today.",NA,"408",NA
"• Consumer confidence is up from the levels seen at this time last year.",NA,"408",NA
"• Inflation remains low by historical standards, as do mortgage rates.",NA,"408",NA
"We know what brought us this success - the hard work of the American people and the Republican commitment to low taxes.",NA,"408",NA
"Now we must keep our economy on the right path by preventing taxes on families from going up next year, making the tax relief of the last four years permanent, and reforming the tax code to make it simpler, fairer, and more growth-oriented.",NA,"408",NA
"Tax Reform",NA,NA,NA
"In 2000 we rightly declared: ""The federal tax code is dysfunctional.",NA,"402",NA
"It penalizes hard work, marriage, thrift, and success - the very factors that are the foundations for lasting prosperity.",NA,"402",NA
""" As noted earlier, from reducing marginal income tax rates to phasing out the death tax, President Bush and the Republican Congress have made great strides in addressing each of these problems.",NA,"402",NA
"However, it is equally obvious that much more remains to be done to reform the federal tax code.",NA,"402",NA
"Instead of being simple, the current tax system is needlessly complex, making it susceptible to abusive tax avoidance schemes.",NA,"404",NA
"Instead of being efficient, it punishes hard work, discourages savings and investment, and hinders the international competitiveness of U.S. firms.",NA,"404",NA
"Instead of being fair, it is out of line with our basic values and undermines our sense of fairness.",NA,"404",NA
"Instead of being predictable, it is highly unpredictable and uncertain.",NA,"404",NA
"Tax reform is necessary to achieve the simplicity, efficiency, fairness, and predictability that the American people deserve, and to give all Americans the freedom to determine their own spending priorities.",NA,"404",NA
"In particular, we must:",NA,NA,NA
"•Make the tax relief of 2001 and 2003 permanent.",NA,"402",NA
"The various expiring tax relief provisions, ranging from 2005 to 2011, make the tax code confusing for everybody and limits the ability of workers, families, and businesses to plan for the future with confidence.",NA,"402",NA
"Nowhere is this more apparent than with the death tax, which is reduced now, disappears in 2010, and then comes fully back to life in 2011.",NA,"402",NA
"• Build on efforts to develop a tax code that does not punish taxpayers for saving.",NA,"402",NA
"• Replace the tax code with a system that is simpler, provides more freedom to our citizens, is pro-growth, boosts the economy, and encourages savings and investment.",NA,"303",NA
"A code that provides several definitions of a child is a code that needs to be reformed.",NA,"303",NA
"We support legislation requiring a super-majority vote in both houses of Congress to raise taxes.",NA,"303",NA
"We will prohibit retroactive taxation and will not tolerate attempts by federal judges to impose taxes.",NA,"000",NA
"We oppose all attempts by the United Nations to impose a global tax and reject any claims of authority by United Nations to do so.",NA,"109",NA
"Because of the vital role of religious and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering charity and patriotism, they should not be subject to taxation.",NA,"706",NA
"Alternative Minimum Tax",NA,NA,NA
"The alternative minimum tax (AMT) represents a second tax system for individuals.",NA,"303",NA
"Its stated goal is to insure that high-income taxpayers pay some amount of income tax.",NA,"303",NA
"But due to the lack of indexing, the broad base and reach of the current AMT will make it apply increasingly to middle-income taxpayers.",NA,"303",NA
"Millions of additional taxpayers must complete AMT forms just to determine that they are not subject to the tax.",NA,"303",NA
"As we look at the broader issue of tax reform, we call upon Congress to address this increasingly unfair second tax system on hardworking Americans.",NA,"303",NA
"Fiscal Discipline and Government Reform",NA,NA,NA
"To make sure the private sector has the capital it needs to invest, grow the economy, and expand prosperity, our leaders must make sure that the growth of the federal government remains in check.",NA,"404",NA
"The challenges America has faced over the last four years have created an unwelcome but manageable budget deficit.",NA,"404",NA
"These deficits are due to a number of factors: the stock market downturn that began in 2000 and the subsequent recession that President Bush inherited when he took office; the terrorist attacks on America and the necessary spending for homeland security and the War on Terror those attacks precipitated; and the crisis in confidence produced by corporate scandals that were years in the making.",NA,"404",NA
"It is important to view the size of the deficit in relation to the size of the nation's economy.",NA,"404",NA
"By that measure, today's deficit, although unwelcome, is well within historical ranges.",NA,"404",NA
"A deficit that is 3. 8 percent of GDP, as is now projected for this year, would be smaller than the deficits in nine of the last 25 years, and far below the peak deficit figure of 6 percent of GDP reached in 1983.",NA,"404",NA
"This deficit is also in line with what other industrialized nations are facing today.",NA,"404",NA
"The U. S. deficit matches the average deficit within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and is below the levels of France, Germany, and Japan.",NA,"404",NA
"Much more importantly, because the President and Congress enacted pro-growth economic policies, the deficit is headed strongly in the right direction.",NA,"404",NA
"Next year's projected deficit, at 2. 7 percent of GDP, would be smaller than those in 14 of the last 25 years.",NA,"404",NA
"As Republicans in Congress work with the President to restrain spending and strengthen economic growth, the federal deficit will fall to 1. 5 percent of the nation's economic output in 2009 - well below the 2. 2 percent average of the last 40 years.",NA,"404",NA
"The events that brought us into deficit are not completely behind us.",NA,"404",NA
"The War on Terror goes on.",NA,"404",NA
"The recession has passed, but some industries and workers are still feeling its effects.",NA,"404",NA
"Republicans are committed to winning the War on Terror and will continue to implement policies that promote jobs, investment, and growth in every region of the country and every sector of our economy.",NA,"404",NA
"Let us be clear: If government is to meet the most pressing needs of our time and still maintain fiscal discipline, government leaders must set priorities and stick with them.",NA,"404",NA
"President Bush has shown genuine leadership in doing just that.",NA,"404",NA
"Time and again, he has made difficult decisions and followed through with clear determination.",NA,"404",NA
"He has made it plain that his top budgetary priority is to protect America and win the War on Terror.",NA,"404",NA
"He also remains committed to the education reforms he spearheaded in 2001.",NA,"404",NA
"All discretionary spending must be kept in check and taxes must remain low to stimulate economic growth.",NA,"404",NA
"We endorse the President's pro-growth economic policies and his disciplined approach to spending taxpayers' dollars.",NA,"404",NA
"And we applaud the efforts of President Bush and Republicans in Congress to meet our nation's priorities and cut the deficit by more than half within five years.",NA,"404",NA
"PAYGO",NA,NA,NA
"Tax cuts and spending are not the same.",NA,"404",NA
"They do not have the same effect on the economy or on the federal budget.",NA,"404",NA
"Tax cuts allow American workers, families, business owners, and investors to keep more of their own money.",NA,"404",NA
"New spending requires the government to take control of a bigger slice of the economy.",NA,"404",NA
"We recognize that the problem is not that the American people are taxed too little but that the federal government spends too much.",NA,"404",NA
"To ensure that the federal government respects the burdens on taxpayers and spends only as much as is necessary to accomplish our common goals, we support extending the pay-as-you-go requirement for mandatory spending only.",NA,"404",NA
"Limiting Spending Growth",NA,NA,NA
"Spending limits will help Congress restrain the growth of government.",NA,"404",NA
"We support a cap on discretionary spending that will limit the growth of overall spending while ensuring that priorities such as our nation's security will continue to be met.",NA,"404",NA
"We applaud President Bush for submitting a budget for 2005 that provides significant increases in funding to win the War on Terror and protect the homeland, while limiting the growth in all other non-security related discretionary spending to less than one percent.",NA,"404",NA
"Line-Item Veto",NA,NA,NA
"To further the goal of respecting taxpayers' dollars and restraining spending, we endorse the creation of a line-item veto, which the President could use consistent with the Constitution to reject new appropriations, new mandatory spending, or limited grants of tax benefits (to 100 or fewer beneficiaries) whenever he determines the spending or tax benefits are not essential priorities.",NA,"404",NA
"Under this approach, all savings from the line-item veto would be used for deficit reduction, and could not be applied to other spending.",NA,"404",NA
"Governors across the nation already have and use this tool to reduce unnecessary spending.",NA,"404",NA
"The President should have the same option.",NA,"404",NA
"Sunset Commission",NA,NA,NA
"It is often said that a government program is the closest man has come to achieving immortality.",NA,"303",NA
"Government programs are designed with specific purposes, and they ought to be assessed to determine whether they are meeting their goals.",NA,"303",NA
"We endorse creating a commission to evaluate discretionary spending on federal agencies and programs to ensure that taxpayer funds are being used for the best, most efficient purposes.",NA,"303",NA
"Such a commission would determine whether certain programs are duplicative, wasteful or inefficient, outdated or irrelevant, or failed.",NA,"303",NA
"It would recommend to Congress programs that could be terminated, moved, or restructured to make the government more efficient.",NA,"303",NA
"Management Agenda",NA,NA,NA
"New government programs are frequently created with little review of programs that already exist to address the same perceived problem.",NA,"303",NA
"Over time, numerous programs with overlapping missions and competing agendas grow up alongside one another - wasting money and baffling citizens.",NA,"303",NA
"We support President Bush's vision for government reform, which is guided by three principles.",NA,"303",NA
"Government should be: citizen-centered, not bureaucracy-centered; results-oriented; and market-based, actively promoting rather than stifling innovation through competition.",NA,"303",NA
"The President's management agenda is an effective tool for making sure government is active but limited, focusing on results and obtaining them efficiently.",NA,"303",NA
"Corporate Accountability",NA,NA,NA
"The Republican Party respects and appreciates the private sector as the primary creator of jobs, economic growth, opportunity, and prosperity in our society.",NA,"305",NA
"The private sector functions most effectively when laws are transparent and people respect them - this includes people in positions of power.",NA,"305",NA
"When corporate leaders break the law, they should be punished.",NA,"305",NA
"After fraudulent corporate practices rooted in the irrational exuberance of the late 1990s began to surface in the closing months of 2001, President Bush worked with the Congress to take decisive action to restore honesty and integrity to America's corporate boardrooms.",NA,"605",NA
"In July 2002, President Bush signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the most farreaching reform of American business practices since the 1940s.",NA,"605",NA
"Under this new law, CEOs and Chief Financial Officers are required to personally vouch for the truth and fairness of their companies' disclosures; for the first time, an independent board has been established to oversee the accounting profession; investigators have been given new tools to root out corporate fraud; and enhanced penalties are ensuring that dishonest corporate officials do hard time.",NA,"605",NA
"We applaud President Bush for vigorously enforcing the law to deter and punish further corporate abuses.",NA,"603",NA
"He established an interagency Corporate Fraud Task Force to investigate and prosecute financial crimes; to recover the proceeds of those crimes; and to hold corporate criminals to account.",NA,"603",NA
"Since the Task Force was established two years ago, over 700 violators have been charged and over 300 convictions or guilty pleas secured, including more than 25 former CEOs.",NA,"605",NA
"More than $1 billion in forfeited funds has also been recovered from corporate wrongdoers for return to defrauded creditors and investors.",NA,"605",NA
"Separately, the enforcement budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has more than doubled, and the SEC has issued new rules to ban latetrading and other fraudulent practices engaged in by certain mutual funds.",NA,"605",NA
"Thanks to swift and decisive action by President Bush and the Congress, Americans can trust that corporate executives who operate outside the law will be prosecuted.",NA,"605",NA

"An additional 6 million jobs are made possible by companies based in foreign countries investing here in the United States.",NA,"401",NA
"Consumers have benefited - recent trade agreements save the average family of four $2000 per year by lowering regulatory barriers, eliminating tariffs, and providing more consumer choices.",NA,"401",NA
"Free trade must be fair trade that advances America's economic goals and protects American jobs.",NA,"401",NA
"To achieve this goal, we must act globally, regionally, and bilaterally to negotiate new trade agreements and enforce existing trade commitments.",NA,"401",NA

"•The agreements include high levels of protection and strong enforcement measures for intellectual property.",NA,"401",NA
"•The Administration has also made significant progress in negotiating multi-lateral trade agreements, having just last month revived World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations for the final phase of the Doha round.",NA,"401",NA
"• The revival of these negotiations opens the door to lower tariffs on consumer and industrial goods, reductions in tariffs and trade-distorting export subsidies on agricultural products, and market access and lower regulatory barriers for services.",NA,"401",NA
"The vitality of the U.S. trade agenda depends upon the vigorous enforcement of U.S. trade laws against unfair competition.",NA,"401",NA
"We will not tolerate foreign practices, rules, and subsidization that put our exports and manufacturers on an unequal footing.",NA,"401",NA
"It is not enough to secure signatures on a piece of paper; our trading partners must follow through on the promises they make.",NA,"401",NA
"As part of its trade enforcement efforts, the Bush Administration has imposed more anti-dumping orders on average each year than the previous Administration.",NA,"401",NA
"The United States was the first country in the world to impose a safeguard action against Chinese textile and apparel imports and to file a case against China in the WTO.",NA,"401",NA

"A typical small business with $10 million in annual revenue pays about $150,000 a year in tort liability costs.",NA,"402",NA
"That is money that could be used to invest and hire new employees.",NA,"402",NA
"Inefficiency and waste in the legal system is costing the average American family of four $1,800 every year, equivalent to an extra 3 percent tax on wages.",NA,"402",NA
"And the bulk of jury awards to plaintiffs don't even go to the people who deserve it.",NA,"402",NA
"Injured persons on average collect less than 50 cents of every dollar that the legal system costs.",NA,"402",NA
"Trial lawyers get rich from the misfortune of others.",NA,"402",NA
"If small business is America's economic engine, trial lawyers are the brakes: They cost hundreds of thousands of good jobs, drive honest employers out of business, deprive women of critical medical care - then skip out with fat wallets and nary a thought for the economic havoc and human misery they leave in their wake.",NA,"402",NA
"We praise President Bush and Republicans in Congress for their efforts to reform the legal system by passing meaningful class action reform, asbestos reform, and medical liability reform.",NA,"402",NA
"And we call to account Senate Democrats and the powerful trial lawyer lobby, who have shown no shame in utilizing obstructionist tactics to thwart the efforts of majorities in Congress to provide meaningful relief to all Americans.",NA,"402",NA

"Republicans support a healthy intercity passenger rail system.",NA,"411",NA
"Amtrak provides a valuable service to passengers, especially in the Northeast corridor.",NA,"411",NA

"Clearly the financial problems plaguing Amtrak cannot be solved simply by continued infusions of taxpayer dollars.",NA,"411",NA

"New technologies will allow us to create new job-producing industries and save jobs in industries that have long been staples of America's economy.",NA,"411",NA
"For instance, working with Congressional Republicans, the President has already committed $2 billion over 10 years for clean coal research and development - which helps keep America's coal industry strong and reduces the emissions associated with coal use.",NA,"411",NA

"The drilling footprint can be confined to just 2,000 acres (the entire refuge contains 19 million acres), about the size of Washington's Dulles Airport, on ice roads that melt away in the summer, leaving little trace of human intervention.",NA,"411",NA
"We have already wasted precious time.",NA,"411",NA
"If the previous Administration had not vetoed the ANWR proposal passed by the Republican Congress in 1995, at this moment ANWR would be producing up to one million barrels of oil a day.",NA,"411",NA
"• Republicans strongly support removing unnecessary barriers to domestic natural gas production and expanding environmentally sound production in new areas, such as Alaska and the Rocky Mountains.",NA,"411",NA

"Every child deserves a first-rate education, because every child holds infinite potential, and we should give them every opportunity to reach it.",NA,"506",NA
"We believe there is an inseparable link between a vibrant economy and a highquality education system.",NA,"506",NA

"Education is the key to prosperity and fulfillment - the foundation on which all other success is built.",NA,"506",NA

"It was the most significant overhaul of federal education policy since 1965.",NA,"506",NA
"And it became a promise kept to parents, students, teachers, and every American.",NA,"506",NA
"The law is based on four fundamental pillars:",NA,NA,NA

"We recognize that under the American Constitutional system, education is a state, local, and family responsibility, not a federal obligation.",NA,"301",NA
"Since over 90 percent of public school funding is state and local, not federal, it is obvious that state and local governments must assume most of the responsibility to improve the schools, and the role of the federal government must be limited as we return control to parents, teachers, and local school boards.",NA,"301",NA

"The President and Republicans in Congress recognize that states and local communities are most directly responsible for the quality of education in their schools.",NA,"506",NA
"That is why the No Child Left Behind Act stipulates that the states, not the federal government, develop an accountability plan that will work best for them.",NA,"506",NA

"We must also work to reduce the barriers that are keeping qualified professionals from entering the classroom by expanding alternative pathways to teacher certification - programs like Troops to Teachers, which helps former military personnel become classroom teachers; and Transition to Teaching, which provides training for people who want to become teachers and encourages states to develop and expand alternative routes to teacher licensure and certification.",NA,"506",NA
"Every teacher and every student deserves a safe classroom in which to work and learn.",NA,"506",NA
"The No Child Left Behind Act ensures that teachers and other school professionals can undertake reasonable actions to maintain order and discipline in the classroom without the fear of litigation.",NA,"506",NA

"The cost of providing health care for employees is a major burden for American businesses.",NA,"402",NA
"Health insurance costs for employers have been rising every year since 1996, causing businesses to hire fewer new employees and too many families to go without insurance.",NA,"402",NA
"Studies show that 60 percent of uninsured Americans either work for a small business or are dependent upon someone who does.",NA,"402",NA
"The way to alleviate that burden is to bring down the cost of health care in America.",NA,"402",NA
"Shifting the cost-burden onto the federal or state governments - costs that will ultimately be borne by the taxpayers - is not an effective solution to the problem.",NA,"402",NA
"We must attack the root causes of high health care costs by: aiding small businesses in offering health care to their employees; empowering the self-employed through access to affordable coverage; putting patients and doctors in charge of medical decisions; reducing junk lawsuits and limiting punitive damage awards that raise the cost of health care; and seizing the cost-saving and quality-enhancing potential of emerging health technologies.",NA,"402",NA
"It is also important that we reaffirm our Party's firm rejection of any measure aimed at making health care a government-run enterprise.",NA,"402",NA
"Association Health Plans (AHPs)",NA,NA,NA
"We support legislation to enable small employers to pool together to offer health insurance options to their employees.",NA,"402",NA
"The legislation, already passed by the House, gives small businesses the same purchasing power currently enjoyed by large employers and labor unions.",NA,"402",NA

"In many cases, costs are so prohibitive that many obstetrics/gynecology practices are scaling back service or choosing not to practice altogether.",NA,"411",NA
"Junk lawsuits add at least $60 billion to health care costs in America because doctors are forced to practice defensive medicine, ordering extensive, unnecessary, and expensive tests and procedures to keep trial lawyers at bay.",NA,"411",NA
"The President has proposed, and the Republican House of Representatives has passed, reforms that would speed compensation to injured patients, reduce health care costs, and improve Americans' access to quality health care.",NA,"305",NA
"Shamefully driven by the powerful trial lawyer lobby, Democrat Senators have repeatedly thwarted the efforts of the Republican majority to deliver meaningful medical liability reform.",NA,"305",NA

"The Republican Party reaffirms its commitment to putting patients and doctors ahead of trial lawyers.",NA,"305",NA

"Health Information Technology",NA,NA,NA
"Estimates indicate that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans die each year from medical errors, while as much as $300 billion is spent each year on health care that does not help patients - unnecessary, inappropriate, inefficient, or ineffective treatments.",NA,"411",NA
"This is absolutely unacceptable.",NA,"411",NA
"High costs, medical errors, administrative inefficiencies, and poor coordination are all closely connected to our failure to use health information technology as an integral part of medical care.",NA,"411",NA
"Republicans support President Bush's goal of ensuring that most Americans have electronic health records within the next 10 years.",NA,"411",NA
"He has requested funding for demonstration projects for broader adoption of health IT systems in communities and states.",NA,"411",NA
"Already, the use of health IT in the Veterans Administration has shown improvements in the quality of care and reductions in the cost.",NA,"411",NA
"The Administration is working with private sector innovators to develop reliable, secure methods of storing personal medical information that will broaden the benefits of health IT.",NA,"411",NA
"Privacy is paramount, and participation by patients will be voluntary.",NA,"411",NA
"These electronic health records will be designed to share information among and between health care providers only when authorized by a patient.",NA,"411",NA
"Advances at the nexus of science and technology raise serious moral and legal questions.",NA,"411",NA

"In some states, activist judges are redefining the institution of marriage.",NA,"605",NA
"The Pledge of Allegiance has already been invalidated by the courts once, and the Supreme Court's ruling has left the Pledge in danger of being struck down again - not because the American people have rejected it and the values that it embodies, but because a handful of activist judges threaten to overturn commonsense and tradition.",NA,"605",NA
