"They have nearly doubled the size of the national debt.",NA,"414",NA
"They refuse to control our borders",NA,"601.2",NA
"but try to control our schools, farms, businesses, and even our religious institutions.",NA,"201.1",NA
"They have directly attacked the production of American energy",NA,"401",NA
"and the industry-related jobs that have sustained families and communities.",NA,"701",NA
"The President has been regulating to death a free market economy that he does not like and does not understand.",NA,"401",NA
"He defies the laws of the United States by refusing to enforce those with which he does not agree.",NA,"305.2",NA
"And he appoints judges who legislate from the bench rather than apply the law.",NA,"203",NA
"We, as Republicans and Americans, cannot allow this to continue.",NA,"305.1",NA
"That is why the many sections of this platform affirm our trust in the people, our faith in their judgment, and our determination to help them take back their country.",NA,"202.1",NA
"This means removing the power from unelected, unaccountable government.",NA,"202.1",NA
"This means relieving the burden and expense of punishing government regulations.",NA,"401",NA
"And this means returning to the people and the states the control that belongs to them.",NA,"301",NA
"It is the control and the power to make their own decisions about what’s best for themselves and their families and communities.",NA,"202.1",NA
"This platform is many things: A handbook for returning decision-making to the people.",NA,"202.1",NA
"A guide to the constitutional rights of every American.",NA,"203",NA
"And a manual for the kind of sustained growth that will bring opportunity to all those on the sidelines of our society.",NA,"503",NA

"Prosperity provides the means by which citizens and their families can maintain their independence from government,",NA,"201.1",NA
"raise their children by their own values,",NA,"603",NA
"practice their faith,",NA,"603",NA
"and build communities of cooperation and mutual respect.",NA,"606.1",NA
"It is also the foundation for our nation's global leadership,",NA,"109",NA
"for it is the vigor of our economy which makes possible our military strength and our national security.",NA,"104",NA
"Pundits and Democrats tell us that we should accept the new normal of a slow-growing economy.",NA,"410",NA

"As a result, the number of Americans living in poverty has increased by 7 million,",NA,"503",NA
"our nation's economy has lost nearly $8 trillion of cumulative output compared with an average recovery,",NA,"410",NA

"We offer instead our vision of an opportunity society based on the economics of inclusion.",NA,"503",NA
"Fair and Simple Taxes for Growth",NA,"H",NA
"Republicans consider the establishment of a pro-growth tax code a moral imperative.",NA,"410",NA
"More than any other public policy, the way government raises revenue — how much, at what rates, under what circumstances, from whom, and for whom — has the greatest impact on our economy's performance.",NA,"410",NA
"It powerfully influences the level of economic growth and job creation,",NA,"410",NA
"which translates into the level of opportunity for those who would otherwise be left behind.",NA,"503",NA
"Getting our tax system right will be the most important factor in driving the entire economy back to prosperity.",NA,"410",NA
"The current tax code is rightly the object of both anger and mockery.",NA,"401",NA
"Its length is exceeded only by its complexity.",NA,"401",NA
"We must start anew.",NA,"401",NA
"That will be an enormous undertaking and, if it is to succeed, it must command the attention and approval of the American people.",NA,"606.2",NA
"It cannot be engineered from the top down,",NA,"606.2",NA
"but must have a common sense approach, and be simplified.",NA,"402",NA
"Our proposal is straightforward.",NA,"402",NA
"Wherever tax rates penalize thrift or discourage investment, they must be lowered.",NA,"402",NA

"so that together we can restore economic growth for the American people",NA,"410",NA

"We oppose tax policies that deliberately divide Americans or promote class warfare.",NA,"401",NA
"Because of the vital role of religious organizations, charities, and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering generosity and patriotism,",NA,"603",NA
"they should not be subject to taxation and donations to them should remain deductible.",NA,"603",NA
"To guard against hypertaxation of the American people in any restructuring of the federal tax system,",NA,"401",NA
"any value added tax or national sales tax must be tied to the simultaneous repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment, which established the federal income tax.",NA,"401",NA
"A Competitive America",NA,"H",NA
"Competitiveness equals jobs.",NA,"701",NA
"That equation governs our policies regarding U.S. corporations in the global economy.",NA,"402",NA
"Private investment is a key driver of economic growth and job creation.",NA,"402",NA
"After falling dramatically during the recession, private investment has recovered at a disappointing pace",NA,"402",NA
"due in part to high corporate tax rates",NA,"402",NA
"and increasing regulatory burdens and uncertainty.",NA,"402",NA
"American businesses now face the world's highest corporate tax rates.",NA,"402",NA
"That's like putting lead shoes on your cross-country team.",NA,"402",NA
"It reduces companies' ability to compete overseas, encourages them to move abroad, lessens their investment,",NA,"402",NA
"cripples job creation here at home, lowers American wages,",NA,"701",NA
"and fosters the avoidance of tax liability",NA,"403",NA
"— without actually increasing tax revenues.",NA,"402",NA
"A more damaging policy is hard to imagine.",NA,"402",NA
"We propose to level the international playing field by lowering the corporate tax rate to be on a par with, or below, the rates of other industrial nations.",NA,"402",NA
"We endorse the recommendation of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, as well as the current Administration's Export Council, to switch to a territorial system of taxation  so that profits earned and taxed abroad may be repatriated for job-creating investment here at home.",NA,"402",NA
"We believe American companies should be headquartered in America.",NA,"402",NA
"We should reduce barriers to accomplishing that goal.",NA,"402",NA
"A Winning Trade Policy",NA,"H",NA
"International trade is crucial for all sectors of America's economy.",NA,"407",NA
"Massive trade deficits are not.",NA,"407",NA
"We envision a worldwide multilateral agreement among nations committed to the principles of open markets, what has been called a “Reagan Economic Zone,” in which free trade will truly be fair trade for all concerned.",NA,"407",NA
"We need better negotiated trade agreements that put America first.",NA,"406",NA
"When trade agreements have been carefully negotiated with friendly democracies, they have resulted in millions of new jobs here at home supported by our exports.",NA,"407",NA
"When those agreements do not adequately protect U.S. interests, U.S. sovereignty, or when they are violated with impunity, they must be rejected.",NA,"109",NA
"We cannot allow foreign governments to limit American access to their markets while stealing our designs, patents, brands, know-how, and technology.",NA,"109",NA
"We cannot allow China to continue its currency manipulation, exclusion of U.S. products from government purchases, and subsidization of Chinese companies to thwart American imports.",NA,"109",NA
"The current Administration's way of dealing with these violations of world trade standards has been a virtual surrender.",NA,"109",NA
"Republicans understand that you can succeed in a negotiation only if you are willing to walk away from it.",NA,"109",NA
"A Republican president will insist on parity in trade",NA,"407",NA
"and stand ready to implement countervailing duties if other countries refuse to cooperate.",NA,"407",NA
"At the same time, we look to broaden our trade agreements with countries which share our values and commitment to fairness,",NA,"107",NA
"along with transparency in our commercial and business practices.",NA,"403",NA
"In pursuing that objective, the American people demand transparency, full disclosure,",NA,"403",NA
"protection of our national sovereignty, and tough negotiation on the part of those who are supposed to advance the interests of U.S. workers.",NA,"109",NA
"Significant trade agreements should not be rushed or undertaken in a Lame Duck Congress.",NA,"305.3",NA
"Freeing Financial Markets",NA,"H",NA
"The Republican vision for American banking calls for establishing transparent, efficient markets where consumers can obtain loans they need at reasonable rates based on market conditions.",NA,"401",NA
"Unfortunately, in response to the financial institutions crisis of 2008-2009, the Democratic-controlled Congress enacted the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, otherwise known as Dodd-Frank.",NA,"401",NA
"They did not let the crisis go to waste but used it as an excuse to establish unprecedented government control over the nation's financial markets.",NA,"401",NA
"The consequences have been bad for everyone except federal regulators.",NA,"401",NA
"Rather than address the cause of the crisis — the government's own housing policies",NA,"305.1",NA
"— the new law extended government control over the economy by creating new unaccountable bureaucracies.",NA,"201.1",NA
"Predictably, central planning of our financial sector has not created jobs, it has killed them.",NA,"401",NA
"It has not limited risks, it has created more.",NA,"401",NA
"It has not encouraged economic growth, it has shackled it.",NA,"410",NA
"Since the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the number of community banks has significantly declined,",NA,"401",NA
"and the cost and complexity of complying with the law has created impediments to the remaining banks' ability to support the customers they serve.",NA,"402",NA
"From 13,000 community banks in 1985, only 1,900 remain.",NA,"401",NA
"Still, the majority of agricultural loans and small business loans are made by community banks.",NA,"401",NA
"From start-ups foregone to home loans not made, Dodd-Frank’s excessive regulation and burdensome requirements have helped contribute to the slow economy we all endure today  under President Obama and the Democrats.",NA,"401",NA
"Community banks are essential to ensuring small businesses have easy and affordable access to the capital they need to grow and prosper.",NA,"401",NA
"Community banks should be relieved of excessive regulations.",NA,"401",NA
"We support removing roadblocks and regulations that prevent access to capital.",NA,"401",NA
"The worst of Dodd-Frank is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, deliberately designed to be a rogue agency.",NA,"401",NA
"It answers to neither Congress nor the executive,",NA,"202.3",NA
"has its own guaranteed funding outside the appropriations process,",NA,"202.3",NA
"and uses its slush fund to steer settlements to politically favored groups.",NA,"304",NA
"Its Director has dictatorial powers unique in the American Republic.",NA,"202.3",NA
"Its regulatory harassment of local and regional banks, the source of most home mortgages and small business loans, advantages big banks",NA,"401",NA
"and makes it harder for Americans to buy a home.",NA,"401",NA
"Its one-size-fits-all approach to every issue threatens the diversity of the country’s financial system",NA,"403",NA
"and would leave us with just a few enormous institutions, as in many European countries.",NA,"403",NA
"If the Bureau is not abolished, it should be subjected to congressional appropriation.",NA,"202.3",NA
"In that way, consumer protection in the financial markets can be advanced through measures that are both effective and constitutional.",NA,"403",NA
"Any settlements arising from statutory violations by financial institutions must be used to make whole the harmed consumers,",NA,"403",NA
"with any remaining proceeds given to the general Treasury.",NA,"403",NA
"Diversion of settlement funds to politically- connected parties should be a criminal offense.",NA,"304",NA
"Republicans believe that no financial institution is too big to fail.",NA,"403",NA
"We support legislation to ensure that the problems of any financial institution can be resolved through the Bankruptcy Code.",NA,"403",NA
"We endorse prudent regulation of the banking system to ensure that FDIC-regulated banks are properly capitalized",NA,"403",NA
"and taxpayers are protected against bailouts.",NA,"403",NA
"We will end the government’s use of disparate impact theory in enforcing anti-discrimination laws with regard to lending.",NA,"401",NA
"Responsible Homeownership and Rental Opportunities",NA,"H",NA
"Homeownership expands personal liberty,",NA,"201.1",NA
"builds communities,",NA,"606.1",NA
"and helps Americans create wealth.",NA,"410",NA
"“The American Dream” is not a stale slogan.",NA,"601.1",NA
"It is the lived reality that expresses the aspirations of all our people.",NA,"601.1",NA
"It means a decent place to live,",NA,"401",NA
"a safe place to raise kids,",NA,"603",NA
"a welcoming place to retire.",NA,"503",NA
"It bespeaks the quiet pride of those who work hard to shelter their family",NA,"603",NA
"and, in the process, create caring neighborhoods.",NA,"606.1",NA
"The Great Recession devastated the housing market.",NA,"403",NA
"U.S. taxpayers paid billions to rescue Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae,",NA,"403",NA
"the latter managed and controlled by senior officials from the Carter and Clinton Administrations,",NA,"305.1",NA
"and to cover the losses of the poorly-managed Federal Housing Administration.",NA,"403",NA
"Millions lost their homes, millions more lost value in their homes.",NA,"403",NA
"More than six million households had to move from homeownership to renting.",NA,"403",NA
"Rental costs escalated so that today nearly 12 million families spend more than 50 percent of their incomes just on rent.",NA,"403",NA
"The national homeownership rate has sharply fallen",NA,"403",NA
"and the rate for minority households and young adults has plummeted.",NA,"503",NA
"So many remain unemployed or underemployed,",NA,"701",NA
"and for the lucky ones with jobs, rising rents make it harder to save for a mortgage.",NA,"403",NA
"There is a growing sense that our national standard of living will never be as high as it was in the past.",NA,"410",NA
"We understand that pessimism but do not share it,",NA,"410",NA
"for we believe that sound public policies can restore growth to our economy, vigor to the housing market, and hope to those who are now on the margins of prosperity.",NA,"410",NA
"Our goal is to advance responsible home- ownership while guarding against the abuses that led to the housing collapse.",NA,"403",NA
"We must scale back the federal role in the housing market,",NA,"401",NA
"promote responsibility on the part of borrowers and lenders,",NA,"401",NA
"and avoid future taxpayer bailouts.",NA,"401",NA
"Reforms should provide clear and prudent underwriting standards and guidelines on predatory lending and acceptable lending practices.",NA,"403",NA
"Compliance with regulatory standards should constitute a legal safe harbor to guard against opportunistic litigation by trial lawyers.",NA,"403",NA
"We call for a comprehensive review of federal regulations,",NA,"401",NA
"especially those dealing with the environment,",NA,"401",NA
"that make it harder and more costly for Americans to rent, buy, or sell homes.",NA,"401",NA
"For nine years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in conservatorship and the current Administration and Democrats have prevented any effort to reform them.",NA,"305.1",NA
"Their corrupt business model lets shareholders and executives reap huge profits while the taxpayers cover all loses.",NA,"304",NA
"The utility of both agencies should be reconsidered as a Republican administration clears away the jumble of subsidies and controls that complicate and distort home-buying.",NA,"401",NA
"The Federal Housing Administration, which provides taxpayer-backed guarantees in the mortgage market, should no longer support high- income individuals,",NA,"403",NA
"and the public should not be financially exposed by risks taken by FHA officials.",NA,"403",NA
"We will end the government mandates that required Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and federally- insured banks to satisfy lending quotas to specific groups.",NA,"401",NA
"Discrimination should have no place in the mortgage industry.",NA,"503",NA
"Zoning decisions have always been, and must remain, under local control.",NA,"301",NA
"The current Administration is trying to seize control of the zoning process through its Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulation.",NA,"301",NA
"It threatens to undermine zoning laws in order to socially engineer every community in the country.",NA,"603",NA
"While the federal government has a legitimate role in enforcing non-discrimination laws,",NA,"503",NA
"this regulation has nothing to do with proven or alleged discrimination and everything to do with hostility to the self-government of citizens.",NA,"301",NA
"America on the Move",NA,"H",NA
"Our country's investments in transportation and other public construction have traditionally been non-partisan.",NA,"411",NA

"Our Republican majority ended the practice of earmarks, which often diverted transportation spending to politically favored projects.",NA,"401",NA
"In the current Congress, Republicans have secured the longest reauthorization of the Highway Trust Fund in a decade",NA,"411",NA
"and are advancing a comprehensive reform of the Federal Aviation Administration to make flying easier and more secure.",NA,"411",NA
"The current Administration has a different approach.",NA,"401",NA
"It subordinates civil engineering to social engineering as it pursues an exclusively urban vision of dense housing and government transit.",NA,"401",NA
"Its ill-named Livability Initiative is meant to “coerce people out of their cars.”",NA,"401",NA
"This is the same mentality that once led Congress to impose by fiat a single maximum speed limit for the entire nation, from Manhattan to Montana.",NA,"401",NA
"Our 1980 Republican Platform pledged to repeal that edict.",NA,"401",NA
"After the election of Ronald Reagan, we did.",NA,"401",NA
"Now we make the same pledge regarding the current problems in transportation policy.",NA,"401",NA

"Additional funds are used for bike-share programs, sidewalks, recreational trails, landscaping, and historical renovations.",NA,"411",NA

"we will remove legal roadblocks to public-private partnership agreements that can save the taxpayers' money and bring outside investment to meet a community's needs.",NA,"401",NA
"With most of the states increasing their own funding for transportation,",NA,"301",NA
"we oppose a further increase in the federal gas tax.",NA,"401",NA

"We will correct that mistake.",NA,"702",NA
"Americans understand that, with the threat of terrorism, their travel may encounter delays,",NA,"104",NA

"Those injuries require a new commitment of targeted resources and personnel for treatment and care to advance recovery.",NA,"504",NA

"We will seek to consolidate the VA's existing community care authorities to make a single program that will be easily understood by both veterans and VA healthcare providers.",NA,"504",NA
"Like the rest of American medicine, the VA faces a critical shortage of primary care and mental health physicians.",NA,"504",NA
"That's why there are long waiting times to see a doctor and why doctors are often frustrated by the limited time they have with their patients.",NA,"504",NA

"As a party, we seek to honor their sacrifice and comfort their families by ensuring all veterans' cemeteries are adequately equipped and a standard of care established, using Arlington Cemetery as a guide, that is befitting their service.",NA,"706",NA
"The level of financial distress and homelessness among vets is a shame to the nation.",NA,"503",NA
"For a veteran, a job is more than a source of income.",NA,"701",NA
"It is a new mission, with a new status, and the transition can be difficult.",NA,"706",NA
"We urge the private sector to make hiring vets a company policy and commend the organizations that have proven programs to accomplish this.",NA,"706",NA
"We will retain the preference given to veterans when they seek federal employment.",NA,"706",NA
"We urge closer coordination with the state offices for veterans' affairs,",NA,"706",NA
