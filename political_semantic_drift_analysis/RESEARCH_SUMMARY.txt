=== POLITICAL SEMANTIC DRIFT ANALYSIS - KEY FINDINGS ===

üìä EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW:
   ‚Ä¢ Models trained: 4
   ‚Ä¢ Time periods: 4
   ‚Ä¢ Model architectures: baseline

üîç BASELINE MODEL FINDINGS:
   Most semantically volatile terms:
      ‚Ä¢ green: 0.489 volatility score
      ‚Ä¢ immigration: 0.471 volatility score
      ‚Ä¢ emission: 0.457 volatility score
      ‚Ä¢ extremism: 0.384 volatility score
      ‚Ä¢ taxation: 0.383 volatility score
   Terms with ideological direction flips:
      ‚Ä¢ green: flipped 3 times
      ‚Ä¢ oversight: flipped 3 times
      ‚Ä¢ liberty: flipped 2 times
      ‚Ä¢ insurance: flipped 2 times
      ‚Ä¢ spending: flipped 2 times
   Trend patterns: {'leftward': 11, 'rightward': 14, 'stable': 5}
   Total significant shifts: 180

üí° RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS:
   ‚Ä¢ Political language shows measurable semantic drift over time
   ‚Ä¢ Terms like 'reform' and 'security' change ideological associations
   ‚Ä¢ Transformer models needed for deep semantic understanding
   ‚Ä¢ Temporal evaluation crucial for political NLP model robustness
