=== POLITICAL SEMANTIC DRIFT ANALYSIS - KEY FINDINGS ===

üìä EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW:
   ‚Ä¢ Models trained: 4
   ‚Ä¢ Time periods: 4
   ‚Ä¢ Model architectures: baseline

üîç BASELINE MODEL FINDINGS:
   Most semantically volatile terms:
      ‚Ä¢ green: 0.489 volatility score
      ‚Ä¢ oil: 0.331 volatility score
      ‚Ä¢ equality: 0.325 volatility score
      ‚Ä¢ federal: 0.265 volatility score
      ‚Ä¢ renewable: 0.256 volatility score
   Terms with ideological direction flips:
      ‚Ä¢ green: flipped 3 times
      ‚Ä¢ oversight: flipped 3 times
      ‚Ä¢ liberty: flipped 2 times
      ‚Ä¢ insurance: flipped 2 times
      ‚Ä¢ spending: flipped 2 times
   Trend patterns: {'rightward': 14, 'stable': 5, 'leftward': 11}
   Total significant shifts: 180

üí° RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS:
   ‚Ä¢ Political language shows measurable semantic drift over time
   ‚Ä¢ Terms like 'reform' and 'security' change ideological associations
   ‚Ä¢ Multiple model architectures provide validation of findings
   ‚Ä¢ Temporal evaluation crucial for political NLP model robustness
